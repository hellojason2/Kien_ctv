# Logo Installation Instructions

## Required Logo File

Please save the **Tâm Thẩm Mỹ Viện** logo image as:

```
/Users/thuanle/Documents/Ctv/static/images/tam-logo.png
```

## Logo Specifications

- **File Name**: `tam-logo.png`
- **Recommended Format**: PNG with transparent background
- **Recommended Size**: At least 200x200 pixels (higher resolution is better)
- **Color**: The gold/tan color from your logo will complement the existing pastel gradient theme

## Where the Logo Appears

The logo will be displayed in two places:

1. **Sidebar** (left navigation): 50x50 pixels
2. **Header** (top of main content): 80x80 pixels

Both will automatically scale the image to fit, so a high-resolution source is recommended.

## After Adding the Logo

Once you place the `tam-logo.png` file in the `/static/images/` directory, the logo will automatically appear on the CTV Portal without any additional changes needed.

The logo styling has been configured to:
- Maintain aspect ratio
- Add a subtle drop shadow
- Match the modern glassmorphism design of the portal
- Work responsively on all screen sizes
